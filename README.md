# RollingDice
Rolling dice with Ploty:
For this project I used the Python package Ploty to make an interactive visualization.  Ploty is a very useful tool in data visualization, because the visualization will scale to your browser and will be interactive when a user goes over certain elements on the screen for example like values. The project will go through rolling two six sided dices and seeing the results. When rolling one dice all the sides of the dice have an equal chance of showing up, but when two dices are rolled certain numbers roll more rather than others. The study of rolling a dice is used in mathematics to show various type of data analysis, but it does have the use in real world applications in casinos and other gambling scenarios.

An example of the output of the program can be found in the file newplot.png.
